🎯 Hangman Game (React + TypeScript)
This project is a simple Hangman game built using React and TypeScript. The game displays a virtual keyboard where players can guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

✨ Features:

Interactive Keyboard: Players can click letters to guess the word.

State Management: Tracks active (correct) and inactive (wrong) letters.
Disabled Letters: Once a letter is guessed, it cannot be clicked again.

CSS Modules for Styling: Custom styles for active, inactive, and default buttons.

📌 How It Works:

A random word is chosen.
The player clicks letters on the keyboard to guess the word.
Correct letters are displayed, while wrong guesses mark letters as inactive.
The game continues until the word is guessed or the player runs out of attempts.
